## Advance Seismic Methods and other geophysical techniques for Energy Resources, PHY-NGRI-3-4004 
In this course I will present basics theory of seismic wave propagation and some related applications. 
The course structure (not complete yet) is presented below is tentative and can be changed according to the audiance requirement. 

**Prerequisite**   
A background in physics, calculus and mathematical methods, and signal processing

**Course Outline**
1. Acousitc wave equation and its solution (2 Lectures)
2. Concept of Stress/strain (2 Lectures)  
3. Elastic wave formulation and its solution (2 Lectures)
5. Energy partitioning for normal and oblique incidence (1 Lecture)
6. Green function and related theorems  ( Uniqueness, Representation, Reciprocity, Lippman-schwinger, etc.) (2 Lectures)
8. Seismic sources representation 
9. Concept and mathematical description of Imaging methods- Diffraction summation, Kirchoff method, RTM and FWI (3 Lectures). 
10. Finite difference modeling (2 Lectures)

**Optional**   
Seismic sources and receivers charateristics,   
2D/3D Acquisition,   
(rest, yet to include)


**Grading Policy**   
The grades are categorized in three parts
1. Attendance 10%
2. Assignment 20%   
3. Final exam 70% 

All the assignments must to be handed over before the due dates. Late submission will face a penalty of 20% for each delayed week. If the assignments are found to be copied (among student/from internet) it will be graded as zero.


**Lecture Venue**    
AcSIR lecture Hall, Ist Floor,
Ext Building, CSIR-NGRI.
