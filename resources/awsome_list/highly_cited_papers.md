Here I try to include some of the very **highly cited papers in geophysics**, which are of interest to me. 


*  [Linear Models of Dissipation whose Q is almost Frequency Independent](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1967.tb02303.x)
*  [1995-GJI-Constraints on seismic velocities in the Earth from traveltimes-B. L. N. Kennett, E. R. Engdahl, R. Buland](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1995.tb03540.x)
