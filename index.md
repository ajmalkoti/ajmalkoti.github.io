### Education
**Ph.D.** in Physical Sciences from AcSIR at [National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, India](https://www.ngri.org.in/)       
**M.Sc.** in Geophysics from [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, WB, India](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/GG)      
**B.Sc.** in Physical Sciences (Electronics) from [University of Delhi, India](http://www.du.ac.in/du/)  


### Research Interests
I am a exploration geophysicist with an interest on seismic wave propagation in earth. I am interested in observing, modeling and explaining the phenonmenons that might be of interest in geophysics. For the reson, I develope my own codes for numerical simulation. The simulation are capable of generating the full seismic wavefiled for a given model yet limited by the governing physics and numerical accuracy. I am equally interested in numerical methods as it serves the immidiate demand in the seismic inversion procedures. 


### Research Work
I have research experience in following fields. 
1. Ambient noise seismology: 
2. Exploration Seismics: 
   Upscaling the elastic medium properties 
3. Numerical methods: 
   High fideliety derivative operators
4. Computational methods: 
    A staggered grid is decomposed independent grids to achieve the Vectoriation. 
    This has a significant effect on speed up depending upon dimentionality of model, i.e., speed up 3-4 times (in 2D) to speed up 20 times (in 3D).
    The scheme has been applied to acoustic/elastic/viscoelastic (2D) and anisotropic(3D) model.
