### Research Interests
I am a exploration geophysicist with an interest on seismic wave propagation in earth. I am interested in observing, modeling and explaining the phenonmenons that might be of interest in geophysics. For the reson, I develope my own codes for numerical simulation. The simulation are capable of generating the full seismic wavefiled for a given model yet limited by the governing physics and numerical accuracy. I am equally interested in numerical methods as it serves the immidiate demand in the seismic inversion procedures. 


### Research Work
I have research experience in following fields. 
1. Ambient noise seismology: 
   Ambient noise measurement are frequenty used now a days to determine the s-wave structure but for p-wave structure. 
   Our work is aimed towards overcoming this limitation.   
2. Exploration Seismics: 
   The real medium is filled with very small scale heterogenieties. 
   The waves propagating in the medium experieces the combined effect of the background and heterogenities. 
   The computational cost of the simulation for the heterogeniety is extremely large, therefore, 
   I have proposed a new mehtod to upscale the medium properties to coarse grids.   
   This reveals the nature of medium experience by the travelling wave. For example, a medium consist of fine isotropic layers may behave as anisotropic media.
   Further computational cost is reduced as now the simulation is on coarse grids.    
3. Numerical methods: 
   I have used high fideliety implicit derivative operators and employed for numerical simulation of seismic wave. 
   The numerical derivatives has shown a formal accuracy of 6th order explicit scheme but spectrally equivalent to a 10th order explict scheme.    
4. Computational methods:    
    A staggered grid is decomposed independent grids to achieve the Vectoriation. 
    This has a significant effect on speed up depending upon dimentionality of model, i.e., speed up 3-4 times (in 2D) to speed up 20 times (in 3D).
    The scheme has been applied to acoustic/elastic/viscoelastic (2D) and anisotropic(3D) model.
