### Education
**Ph.D.** in Physical Sciences from AcSIR at National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, India

**M.Sc.** in Geophysics from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal, India

**B.Sc.** in Physical Sciences from University of Delhi, India  


### Research Interests
I am a exploration geophysicist with an interest on seismic wave propagation in earth. I am interested in observing, modeling and explaining the phenonmenons that might be of interest in geophysics. For the reson, I develope my own codes for numerical simulation. The simulation are capable of generating the full seismic wavefiled for a given model yet limited by the governing physics and numerical accuracy. I am equally interested in numerical methods as it serves the immidiate demand in the seismic inversion procedures. 


### Research Work
A Latex bib file containing information about my research. [Link](https://github.com/ajmalkoti/ajmalkoti.github.io/blob/main/mybib/all.bib)

1. Ambient noise seismology: 
2. Exploration Seismics: 
   Upscaling the elastic medium properties 
3. Numerical methods: 
   High fideliety derivative operators
4. Computational methods: 
    A staggered grid is decomposed independent grids to achieve the Vectoriation. 
    This has a significant effect on speed up depending upon dimentionality of model, i.e., speed up 3-4 times (in 2D) to speed up 20 times (in 3D).
    The scheme has been applied to acoustic/elastic/viscoelastic (2D) and anisotropic(3D) model.
