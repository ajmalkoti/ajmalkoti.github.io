### Ajay Malkoti 
(At present)  
Visiting Researcher 
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India 
[CV](https://link_here)

### Education
**Ph.D.** in Physical Sciences from AcSIR at National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, India

**M.Sc.** in Geophysics from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal, India

**B.Sc.** in Physical Sciences from University of Delhi, India  


### Research Interests
I am a exploration geophysicist with an interest on seismic wave propagation in earth. I am interested in observing, modeling and explaining the phenonmenons that might be of interest in geophysics. For the reson, I develope my own codes for numerical simulation. The simulation are capable of generating the full seismic wavefiled for a given model yet limited by the governing physics and numerical accuracy. I am equally interested in numerical methods as it serves the immidiate demand in the seismic inversion procedures.
