**M.Sc.** in Geophysics from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal, India
**B.Sc.** in Physical Sciences from University of Delhi, India  


### Research Interests
I am a exploration geophysicist with an interest on seismic wave propagation in earth. I am interested in observing, modeling and explaining the phenonmenons that might be of interest in geophysics. For the reson, I develope my own codes for numerical simulation. The simulation are capable of generating the full seismic wavefiled for a given model yet limited by the governing physics and numerical accuracy. I am equally interested in numerical methods as it serves the immidiate demand in the seismic inversion procedures.
