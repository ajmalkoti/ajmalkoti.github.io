### Research Interests
I am an exploration geophysicist with an interest in seismic wave propagation in the earth. I am interested in observing, modeling, and explaining the phenomenons that might be of interest in geophysics. For this reason, I develop my codes for numerical simulation. The simulation is capable of generating the full seismic wavefield for a given model yet is limited by the governing physics and numerical accuracy. I am equally interested in numerical methods as it serves the immediate demand in the seismic inversion procedures.


### Research Work
I have research experience in the following fields.     
1. _Ambient noise seismology_:       
   Ambient noise measurements are frequently used nowadays to determine the s-wave structure but for the p-wave structure. Our work is aimed at overcoming this limitation.      
2. _Exploration seismics_:       
   The real medium is filled with very small scale heterogeneities. 
   The waves propagating in the medium experiences the combined effect of the background and heterogeneities. 
   The computational cost of the simulation for the heterogeneity is extremely large, 
   therefore, I have proposed a new method to upscale the medium properties to coarse grids. 
   This reveals the nature of the medium experience by the traveling wave. 
   For example, a medium consist of fine isotropic layers may behave as anisotropic media. 
   Further computational cost is reduced as now the simulation is on coarse grids.          
3. _Numerical methods_:     
   I have used high fidelity implicit derivative operators and employed for numerical simulation of seismic wave. 
   The numerical derivative has shown a formal accuracy of the 6th order explicit scheme but 
   spectrally equivalent to a 10th order explicit scheme.    
4. _Computational methods_:      
    A staggered grid is decomposed independent grids to achieve the Vectorization. 
    This has a significant effect on speed up depending upon the dimensionality of 
    a model, i.e., speed up 3-4 times (in 2D) to speed up 20 times (in 3D). 
    The scheme has been applied to acoustic/elastic/viscoelastic (2D) and anisotropic(3D) models.
