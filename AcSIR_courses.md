## Geophysical Inverse Theory  
In this course I will discuss fundamental theory underlying the geophysical inversion. 
It should help students to develop an understanding for the problem and and itutions for the solution/method. 
The course structure (not complete yet) is presented below is tentative and can be changed according to the audiance requirement. 

**Prerequisite** A background in physics and mathematics (partiularly, calculus and algebra)
