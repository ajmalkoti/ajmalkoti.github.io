## Geophysical Inverse Theory  
In this course I will discuss fundamental theory underlying the geophysical inversion. 
It should help students to develop an understanding for the problem and and itutions for the solution/method. 
The course structure (not complete yet) is presented below is tentative and can be changed according to the audiance requirement. 

**Prerequisite** A background in physics and mathematics (partiularly, calculus and algebra)

**Course Outline**
1. Basic programming in Python (2 lectures + assignment)
2. Linear algebra and subspace (2 lectures)
3. Linear inverse theory- LSq, ML, GI, constraints and Examples  (2 lecture + assignment)   
4. Nonlinear inverse theory	and Iterative (gradient) based procedures
5. Global optimization methods-SA, GA (2 Lectures + assignment)
6. Monte carlo methods (2 Lectures + assignment)
9. Probablistic/baysian inversion		(2 lectures + assignment)
10. Paper presentation 				         

**Optional**
1. Continuous inverse theory 
2. Numerical matrix inversion techniques
3. Neural network	


**Grading Policy**
The grades are categorized in three parts
1. Attendance 10% 
2. Assignment 20% 
3. Final exam 70% 
All the assignments must to be handed over before the due dates.
Late submission will face a penalty of 20% for each delayed week. 
If the assignments are found to be copied (among student/from internet) it will be graded as zero.
