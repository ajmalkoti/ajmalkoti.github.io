## Advance Exploration Methods  
In this course I will present basics theory of seismic wave propagation and some related applications. 
The course structure (not complete yet) is presented below is tentative and can be changed according to the audiance requirement. 

**Course Outline**
1. Preliminary Stress/strain/
2. Seismic wave formulation (acoustic, elastic) 
3. Solution to wave equations 
4. Energy partitioning 
5. Green function, 
6. Reciprocity, Lippman-schwinger theorem, Representation theorem 
7. Seismic sources representation and related theorems 
8. Concept and mathematical description of Imaging methods- Diffraction summation, Kirchoff method, RTM and FWI
9. Finite difference modeling 

**Optional**   
Seismic sources and receivers 
2-D Acquisition geometry and related parameter
(rest, yet to include)
