	abstract = {Seismic waves traveling through the Earth interact with heterogeneities of all scales along their path. Generally, we are interested in travel time associated with coarse-scale structures; however, fine-scale structures also influence the amplitude and travel time for all phases. The distribution of fine-scale heterogeneities not only affects travel times but also impacts how we observe subsurface properties via these travel times. For instance, fine-scale isotropic heterogeneities in the medium, that may not be resolved in seismic imaging can induce extrinsic anisotropy on a coarser scale. Further, simulating seismic wavefield in a medium with all scales of heterogeneities requires a huge amount of computation, posing a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an upscaling technique based on the Renormalization Group theory for the 2D elastic wave equation. It is helpful to understand how seismic waves propagate through a medium containing fine-scale structures and how their response is manifested on the seismogram. This approach aims to generate more cost-effective wave simulations by reducing the required number of grid points and providing effective properties at a coarser scale while preserving wavefield accuracy. To validate our approach, we tested different models for different levels of upscaling. The waveforms and wavefields for both original and coarse-scale models matched well, demonstrating that the Renormalization Group theory-based upscaled medium effectively represents the fine-scale medium over a surface-seismic frequency band.},

	abstract = {The permeability of sandstone varies significantly from site to site at the field scale. Well-established methods for permeability estimation depend on laboratory-measured parameters, which are available only at sparse locations. To overcome such dependency, we have developed a method to estimate sandstone’s site-specific and field-scale permeability using well log and interconnected porosity data, respectively. We have considered sandstone as a mono-dispersed porous medium with monofractal pores and simulated them using the fractal theory-based acceptance-rejection Monte Carlo algorithm. Stabilization of the algorithm through an error convergence scheme generated repeatable and reliable permeability values. We tested this developed method on cores from various formations representing clean/shaly sandstones and a few sandstone samples contaminated by carbonates. Compared to laboratory-measured permeability, the estimates are within one-order magnitude error bounds for clean/shaly sandstones and higher for samples that are either contaminated by carbonates or have higher pore volume normalized surface area. We applied the method to infer field-scale permeability trend to explain the unexpected movement of hydrocarbons in the Kalol reservoir lying in the Balol oil field of Cambay Basin India, where the in-situ combustion enhanced oil recovery process is implemented. The field-scale permeability trend could explain the northward movement of the hydrocarbons to the adjacent oil field, Lanwa. It was also observed in the production data of the Lanwa field that the in-situ combustion in Balol has benefited oil production in its wells.},
