# Awsome-geophysics-list

This list intend to contain list of useful tutorial, codes, etc. which might be helpful in geophysics research as well as in teaching. 
At this stage the project includes majorly the codes and a small bit of research material. 
However with time it is inteded to include teaching material as well. 



## Categories 
This list catogorizes the stuff is majorly in following categories
* [Seismic realted stuff](https://github.com/ajmalkoti/seismic-packages-list/blob/main/seismic_codes.md)
* [Seismology realted stuff](https://github.com/ajmalkoti/seismic-packages-list/blob/main/seismology_codes.md)
* [Inversion related stuff](https://github.com/ajmalkoti/awsome-geophysics-list/blob/main/inversion_codes.md)
* [Borehole/Well-log related stuff](https://github.com/ajmalkoti/awsome-geophysics-list/blob/main/borehole_codes.md)
* [Gravity Magnetic, and other fields](https://github.com/ajmalkoti/awsome-geophysics-list/blob/main/GravMagEtc_codes.md)

**Note** 
* The list is supposed to provide an beginning to the topic.
* The list is obviously neither complete nor very exhaustive. 
* It has a biased toward the seismic as it is my primary area of research. 
* You are welcome to suggest the missing packages which may help researchers to expedite their research.
* You are also welcome to suggest a package developed by you (giving more visibility to your work).
