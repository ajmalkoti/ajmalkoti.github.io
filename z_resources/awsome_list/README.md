# Awesome geophysics list

This list contains geophysics related stuff (tutorial, codes, etc.) which might be helpful for the researchers in this domain. The stuff is categorised in following categories : [Seismic](./sec_seismic.md), [Seismology](./sec_seismology.md),  [Inversion](sec_inversion.md), [Borehole/Well-log/Petrophysics](./sec_borehole.md), Programming, [Other fields](./sec_other.md).

**Note** :  The list is obviously neither complete nor very exhaustive. It is just meant to provide a cue to your research. Obviously, it is biased toward the seismic which is the primary area of research of the author.  Apart from that, you are welcome to suggest  the missing packages  by mailing at ajmalkoti@gmail.com.
